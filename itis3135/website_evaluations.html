            <p>This website is extremely visually pleasing website. I'd rate this website at a 9 out of 10... its really just beatiful.
                I also like the fact that when scrolling through the website images stay in class while the text moves. I believe its
                a simple media query but it makes the website fun to explore. This website is a great example of the CRAP principles.

            <ul>
                <li>Contrast: The background is very colorful but not enough to disorient the user. 
                    While colorful the page does an impressive job of giving contrast to the various elements on the page.</li>
                <li>Repetition: Identical UI is used throughout the sites' pages which allows users to become familiar with the site.</li>
                <li>Alignment: Elements on the page are aligned well allowing the user to navigate the page easily. 
                    </li>
                <li>Proximity: There is consistent spacing between the different informational sections on each page. Related elements are in proximity of one another.</li>

            <p>If I had to rate this website on a scale of 1-10 I'd have to give in a 2 at most. This page is visually unappealing and I believe follows the complete oposite principles of CRAP. 
                This website is an experiment for the Yale School of Arts which is the only reason a website like this should be created. This website is a great example of what not to do when creating a website.

            <ul>
                <li>Contrast: Everything on this webpage consists of very similar color schemes. The background is also a picture which disorients the user from tasks they want to complete.</li>
                <li>Repetition: Not much on the website is similar throughout. For example the some links look like normal text while others are buttons or large text that is underlined </li>
                <li>Alignment: Most of the elements on the website are not alligned. he elements of the page are all aligned in a column on the right side of the website.</li>
                <li>Proximity: All the elements on the page are just put wherever there was space on the page. Related elements are not in proximity</li>
