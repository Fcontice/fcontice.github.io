            <li><strong><u>Personal Background</u>:</strong> I was born in NJ and moved to Mooresville, NC at 11 years old. Although I was against the idea of leaving family and friends I fell in love with NC and the city of Charlotte since moving.</li>
            <li><strong><u>Professional Background</u>:</strong> I\’ve mostly worked in the service industry and currently work at Barcelona Wine Bar in Southend.</li>
            <li><strong><u>Academic Background:</u></strong> I graduated High School in the infamous year of 2020, I\’m currently a Junior in the Computer Science program after slowly discovering my passion for tech and innovation.</li>
            <li><strong><u>Background in this Subject</u>:</strong> I\’ve always had a passion for technology and using my creativity. After developing the right discipline that higher education requires, and switching into different majors several times, I found my passion for      computer science.</li>
            <li><strong><u>Primary Computer Platform</u>:</strong> Windows 11</li>
            <li><strong><u>Courses I'm Taking & Why</u>:</strong></li>
            <li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong><u>ITIS 3310 - Software Arch & Design</u>:</strong> I was always creative and was interested in learning how to put my creativity into software.</li>
                    <li><strong><u>ITCS 3112 - Design and Implementation of Object-Oriented Systems</u>:</strong> I mostly wanted to improve my knowledge in Computer Science, this course seemed important to achieving that goal.</li>
                    <li><strong><u>ITCS 3160 - Database Design and Implementation</u>:</strong> This course was essential to my major.</li>
                    <li><strong><u>ITIS 3135 - Web-Based Application Design and Development</u>:</strong> I just recently delved into learning how to build websites and applications. I chose this course to learn more about front-end and backend development.</li>
                    <li><strong><u>ITIS 3130 - Human-Centered Design</u>:</strong> I thought this course would greatly benefit my expertise in designing UI and how to design UI effectively for users.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong><u>Funny/Interesting Item to Remember me by</u>:</strong> During my youth in elementary school Pop Warner Football, I was   announced by two names, “Frank \‘Bonecrusher\’ Conticello” and “The Flying Squirrel”. To answer your question, in one of my games I tackled someone on the opposing team and they had to call an ambulance for his concussion. I\’m not proud of it but that\’s what happened.</li>
